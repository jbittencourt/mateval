MATEVAL was originally developed in order to allow researchers doing field work on a school to keep notes on several students. Later on, features were added that expanded the scope of mateval to become a tool for teachers to keep collectively keep track of notes about their students, allowing a more comprehensive view of a student progress inside a school.
